# Bike-Sharing Demand Analysis and Prediction Using Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

## Overview
This project investigates the factors influencing bike-sharing demand in urban areas. By leveraging a detailed dataset and employing Generalized Linear Models (GLM), we constructed predictive models to understand and forecast bike-sharing usage patterns. The results provide actionable insights that could guide operational improvements in bike-sharing systems.

This work is the result of a collaborative effort between Kevin Wardakhan, Ibrahim Abdelatif, and Erwan Ouabdesselam, showcasing teamwork and shared expertise throughout the project.

## Objectives
- Identify key environmental, temporal, and contextual factors affecting bike-sharing demand.
- Build and validate a robust predictive model to forecast demand.
- Use insights to better understand the behavior of users and inform management decisions for optimizing bike-sharing operations.

## Methodology
This project followed a structured and methodical approach with the following phases:

### 1. **Data Preparation and Exploration**
   - **Dataset**: The dataset consists of 1,817 observations with 13 explanatory variables, encompassing environmental, temporal, and contextual factors.
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Removed irrelevant columns and redundant data.
     - Transformed categorical variables into factors to facilitate statistical analysis.
     - Addressed missing data to ensure dataset completeness.
     - Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets for model building and evaluation.
   - **Exploratory Analysis**:
     - Conducted descriptive statistical analysis to understand variable distributions.
     - Visualized relationships between the predictors (e.g., temperature, humidity, season) and the target variable (number of bike rentals).

### 2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - **Correlation Matrix**:
     - Identified strong correlations among variables to avoid multicollinearity (e.g., high correlation between temperature measures).
   - **Key Predictors Identified**:
     - Temperature: Both mean and perceived temperatures show a positive influence on bike rentals.
     - Humidity: High humidity negatively impacts bike usage.
     - Temporal Factors: Demand is highest during peak commuting hours and in warmer seasons.

### 3. **Modeling with GLM**
   - **Transformations**:
     - Applied Box-Cox transformation to normalize the bike rentals variable.
     - Added quadratic terms for humidity to better capture its non-linear relationship with demand.
   - **Variable Selection**:
     - Used forward, backward, and stepwise approaches with criteria like AIC, BIC, and Mallow's CP to determine the most impactful predictors.
     - Compared and validated multiple models for performance.
   - **Model Assumptions**:
     - Validated homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, and absence of multicollinearity.
     - Performed ANOVA tests to ensure the statistical significance of included predictors.

### 4. **Interaction Effects**
   - Explored and included meaningful interactions to refine the model:
     - **Time of Day × Season**: Seasonal variations in daily usage patterns.
     - **Weather × Time of Day**: Behavior changes under varying weather conditions.
     - **Temperature × Humidity**: Combined effect on user comfort and demand.
   - These interactions improved the model's explanatory power and predictive accuracy.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Metrics**:
     - Final model achieved an MSE of 217.84, indicating strong predictive accuracy.
     - AIC of 4674.7 confirmed model optimization relative to alternatives.
   - **Final Model**:
     - Forward-selected model with interactions was chosen for its balance of simplicity and performance.

## Results and Insights
- **Key Findings**:
  - Temperature (mean and perceived) significantly increases bike rentals.
  - High humidity reduces demand, highlighting user sensitivity to weather conditions.
  - Seasonal and time-based patterns suggest higher demand during summer and peak hours.
  - Weather and temporal interactions provide nuanced insights into user behavior.
- **Practical Applications**:
  - Redistribute bikes dynamically based on seasonal and hourly trends.
  - Improve planning for extreme weather events to ensure optimal service availability.
- **Model Performance**:
  - Predicted values closely align with actual demand, with minimal error.

## Future Improvements
To further enhance the model and insights:
1. Incorporate additional predictors:
   - Local events and public holidays.
   - Infrastructure-related factors (e.g., bike lanes, station proximity).
2. Explore advanced modeling techniques, such as:
   - Machine learning approaches to capture non-linear relationships.
   - Regularization methods like Ridge or LASSO regression to minimize overfitting.
